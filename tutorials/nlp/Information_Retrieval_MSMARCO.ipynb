We will be working on MSMARCO dataset which contains more than 800K queries and more than 8.8M short passages and the task is to rank all passages by their relevance to the particular query.

Thus, it is common to construct harder negative passages, for example, by selecting irrelevant passages but with high BM25 score. For this tutorial, we will be choosing negative passages randomly.
